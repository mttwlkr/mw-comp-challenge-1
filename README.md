# static-comp-1:

I designed a newsfeed for blockchain projects, tokens and currencies. I used the following reasoning for the pallette, layout and responsiveness;

I get a metallic, darker, city-esque vibe from blockchains. It's similar to banking, but more modern and not as bland as banking, so I added some lighter colors. I started by taking the original colors off the right-side hero picture and adjusting them.

The first box is a static header with an H1 & H3 describing what the product's purpose is and social icons. These social icons disapper on the mobile layout since it's a mobile product at that width and I'd want to keep them on my product.

The rest of the boxes each signify a major, top-20 blockchain currency, token or project. On hover, they turn yellow, on click, they turn dark gray/black to signify which blockchain's news will populate the right hero of the screen. 

The right-side hero is where the news stories for that coin would toggle. On mobile this is shows up just below the header box. The dots/arrows show that these stories can swipe. I felt the arrows were too crowded on mobile and the three dots gave enough direction.

For the purpose of this, I have shown a news story from Ethereum about the release of their Homestead update. So, the ethereum box is selected on load and it's news story is shown.
